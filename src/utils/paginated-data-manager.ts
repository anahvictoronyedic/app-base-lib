/**
 * A class that can be used to manage pagination for a growing list of data. A list based UI can use it to perform infinite scroll.
 * 
 * It expects data to be added in batches which basically is how pagination works for a growing list.
 * 
 * @todo it should be able to receive not only the next batch of data, but an arbitrary batch of data. This will help in features
 * where by a big list of data is searched for data that matches a criteria, and the user has to be taken to where the matching data exists 
 * in the scroll view, which possibly makes the batches not consecutive in order and possibly farther from each other. 
 * Whatsapp has this feature which manifests when one searches the message thread.
